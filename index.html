    <p>
        After getting tired of eating scrambled eggs daily for lunch, 
        I was using ChatGPT to see if I could find a new recipe I could follow along
        to make in my kitchen. The contender for me was making ratatouille.

        I then procrastinated and was watching Mental Outlaw videos. He is known for making videos and tutorials on Linux and FOSS software.
        I also recalled he makes cooking videos. I decided to watch some of those videos and found something worth trying out.
        I used ChatGPT as well to find ways to improve the recipe. I've been eating my FOSS chicken thighs for about 2 months now.
        I did use chicken drumsticks before switching to chicken thighs for extra meat and to help reach at least a week of meal prep.

        I am adding the link of the video I watched from Mental Outlaw's Youtube Channel.
