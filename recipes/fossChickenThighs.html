    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The FOSS chicken thighs are really flavorful, not difficult to follow making, and are relatively cheap that can last you over a week for meal prep.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Preheat the oven:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Preheat your oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Prepare the Chicken:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Pat the thighs dry with a paper towel. This helps them crisp up.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <strong>Season:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In a small bowl, mix olive oil, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, salt, and a good amount of 
                    Grill Mates Montreal Chicken Seasoning. (No I am not sponsored by them) Rub this mixture all over the thighs to coat them evenly.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Bake:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Place the thighs on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Bake for an hour, turning them halfway through for even cooking.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>

                        <li>
                            Increase the oven temperature to 450 degrees fahrenheit for the last 10 minutes to crisp up the skin.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li>
                            Let the thighs rest for 5 minutes before serving.
